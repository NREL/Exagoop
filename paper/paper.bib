    abstract = { An experimental study has been made of some aspects of the phenomena accompanying the collapse of liquid columns on to a rigid horizontal plane with air as the outer medium. The cases covered include the two-dimensional collapse of rectangular and semicircular sections, and the three-dimensional axial collapse of right circular cylinders. As the columns collapsed, the fluid spread across the horizontal plane, attaining a maximum velocity, which, in the two-dimensional cases, was proportional to the square root of the original height. It was not clear whether this proportionality would hold for the axial collapse of cylinders. If it did, then the factor of proportionality would be some 25 \% lower. In the two-dimensional cases the top of the residual column accelerated downwards to a maximum velocity proportional to the square root of the product of the original height and the original height to base ratio. The nature of the subsequent retardation indicated that the downward velocity probably approached zero asymptotically with time. }

   abstract = {Feed spacers are used in spiral wound reverse osmosis (RO) membrane modules to keep the membrane sheets apart as well as to enhance mixing. They are beneficial to membrane performance but at the expense of additional pressure loss. In this study, four types of feed spacer configurations are investigated, with a total of 20 geometric variations based on commercially available spacers and selected filament angles. The impact of feed spacer design on membrane performance is investigated by means of three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, where the solution-diffusion model is employed for water and solute transport through RO membranes. Numerical simulation results show that, for the operating and geometric conditions examined, fully woven spacers outperform other spacer configurations in mitigating concentration polarisation (CP). When designed with a mesh angle of 60°, fully woven spacers also deliver the highest water flux, although the associated pressure drops are slightly higher than their nonwoven counterparts. Middle layer geometries with a mesh angle of 30° produce the lowest water flux. On the other hand, spacers with a mesh angle of 90° show the lowest pressure drop among all the filament arrangements examined. Furthermore, the computational model presented here can also be used to predict membrane performance for a given feed spacer type and geometry.},

Critical to this effort are the minimization of freshwater withdrawals and elimination of wastewater discharge, both of which can be achieved via zero liquid discharge (ZLD), an aggressive wastewater management approach. Because of the high energetic cost of thermal desalination, ZLD is particularly challenging for high-salinity wastewaters. In this review, we discuss the potential of high-pressure reverse osmosis (HPRO) (i.e., reverse osmosis operated at a hydraulic pressure greater than ∼100 bar) to efficiently desalinate hypersaline brines. We first discuss the inherent energy efficiency of membrane processes compared to that of conventional thermal processes for brine desalination. We then highlight the opportunity of HPRO to reduce energy requirements for desalination of key high-salinity industrial wastewaters. The current state of membrane materials and processes for hypersaline brine desalination is also discussed, emphasizing several process design considerations unique to HPRO. Lastly, we discuss the most pressing research needs for the development of HPRO, notably the development of membranes and modules suitable for high pressures as well as fundamental studies of compaction and transport under HPRO conditions.},

   abstract = {Spacer-filled channels are incorporated in membrane modules in reverse osmosis applications where the role of feed spacer is to promote turbulence, improve mass transport and mitigate concentration polarization. The objective of this study is to emulate a realistic spacer, due to manufacturing conditions, spacers tend to have a special complex geometry (deformations) which is usually not adopted in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies, this deformation tends to be of a torsioned shape. A total of 18 simulations were conducted for torsioned and non-torsioned spacers evaluating concentration polarization and mass transfer across membrane walls at different inlet salinities (co = 400, 500 and 600 mol/m3) and different Reynolds number (Re = 100, 192 and 384) based on the inlet velocity using fully-coupled three dimensional CFD, where the solution-diffusion model was incorporated for the calculations of water and solute fluxes across reverse osmosis membrane. The current comparison illustrates that the torsioned spacers have an overall enhanced performance compared to non-torsioned spacers. It is found that concentration polarization is mitigated in torsioned spacers which is the contrary with non-torsioned spacers having a tendency to concentration polarization, consequently, the water flux in torsioned spacers was found higher than those in non-torsioned spacers. Generally speaking, all membrane modules are found to have a higher performance at higher Reynolds number and at lower inlet salinity. This study proves that spacer geometric details are critical to predict accurately the RO membrane performance.},

   abstract = {Multi-layer feed channel spacers have shown superior mass transfer enhancement than conventional dual-layer spacers used in reverse osmosis (RO) spiral wound membrane modules. However, mass transfer indicators do not directly address the economic advantages of multi-layer spacers. To allow for a direct economic comparison of spacer designs, a simplified multi-scale techno-economic model is proposed which can provide useful cost trends. A total of 8 feed spacer geometries with different attack angles (α = 0–60°) and filament sizes (df/hch = 0.4–0.6) are first investigated using 3D-CFD. Multi-layer spacers typically increase both Sherwood number (~12%) and friction factor (~140%). The techno-economic model is then used to assess the impact of these changes on the total processing cost for RO. The latter analysis found that larger pressure drops associated with multi-layer spacers in long channels have little impact on total water processing cost for RO, with multi-layer spacers showing lower total processing costs (by 2–4%) than the dual-layer spacer for both seawater and brackish water RO. Novel spacer designs should therefore emphasise flux enhancement. The importance of including energy recovery for a more accurate economic analysis is highlighted, especially for systems with low recovery ratio.},

A model based on the material point method was set to study the whole stress–strain relationship of representative realistic foam sample, obtained from CT-scans. The dynamic model was validated to compression results from Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar experiments allowing the study of a shock due to a container fall. Direct influence of the microstructure was then evaluated. We first added virtual realistic manufacturing defects on the geometry and then studied the foam behavior of fully computer-designed microstructures.

   abstract = {Coal mine waters often have high salinity, hardness and alkalinity. The treatment of coal mine water requires careful management of multi-stage reverse osmosis (RO) systems to achieve effective recovery of water for domestic reuse, as well as zero liquid discharge to minimise the impact to the local environment. Design of RO systems for coal mine water treatment has been limited to the use of commercial design packages provided by membrane manufacturers, which do not provide insights into the impact of operating parameters such as feedwater salinity, concentrations of sparingly soluble salts, feed pressure and their interactions with different RO modules on the fouling/scaling potential of RO membranes. This also restricts the use of novel RO products and the delivery of an optimum design based on real needs. In this work, a mathematical model was developed to simulate a standard brackish water RO pressure vessel consisting six full-size RO membrane elements, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The model can be used to predict the permeate flowrate, water recovery levels, as well as the spatial information of the accumulation and scaling potential of sparingly soluble salts on the membrane surface. The results obtained from the model showed good agreement with the results obtained from the commercial RO design software WAVE. The CFD model was then used to predict the scaling threshold on various positions of a full-scale RO element, at different operating conditions, using parametric simulations based on Central Composite Designs. Outputs from this work not only provide insights into the microscopic flow characteristics of multiple full-scale elements in the RO pressure vessel, but also predicts the position where scaling would occur, at different feed conditions, for any RO products.},

   abstract = {Existing desalination plants face the challenges of high energy costs and environmental impacts from brine disposal. Pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) is a membrane-based technology that could mitigate these issues by capturing the potential energy in the salinity gradient between brine and dilute (e.g., freshwater/wastewater) solutions. Currently, a major challenge facing PRO is concentration polarization (CP), which is the reduction of the salinity gradient caused by the buildup of solutes along both the brine side of the membrane surface (external) and within the membrane support structure (internal). CP can be reduced using membrane spacers, but they have the drawback of increasing the pressure drop along the length of the feed channel. Therefore, it is important to design a membrane spacer that can minimize the effects of both CP and the internal pressure drop. In this study, we simulated the effect that membrane spacer geometries have on CP and the internal pressure drop via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using the open-source software, OpenFOAM. Simulations were validated using experimental results for five physical spacer geometries on a bench-scale PRO system. The highest performing physical spacer geometry was a 47 mil (1.41 mm) thick parallel oriented spacer (47P), which was then improved upon through integrated CFD-based optimization using the open-source optimization toolkit, DAKOTA. Single-objective genetic algorithms were used to iteratively modify the spacer geometry by increasing the linearity of the thinner cross-strand and decreasing the linearity of the thicker parallel strand, which created a more hexagonally shaped cross-section. This modification was able to increase overall system performance, which was represented by the ratio of the mass flux density of the feed permeate through the membrane to the pressure drop across the length of the feed channel, by 16.3%. This suggests that a membrane spacer with a parallel hexagonal configuration allows the fluid to flow with minimal internal pressure drop while still creating the necessary back-mixing from the membrane surface to the bulk fluid needed to promote mass transfer and reduce the impacts of CP. Implementing these improvements in spacer design would cause the feed pump to consume less energy, which would increase the net energy generation potential and overall sustainability of PRO systems.},

   abstract = {Reverse Osmosis has important applications to seawater desalination and advanced water treatment. Its efficiency depends, however, on unsteady fluid flow and solute transport that are challenging to simulate. The challenges arise due to interactions between solute boundary layers and unsteady vortical flow structures generated by complicated geometries. These flow structures also interact with semi-permeable membranes through which the permeate flow depends on the local pressure. We show that this additional pressure coupling causes the temporal accuracy of traditional projection methods to drop to first-order. We track the source of this accuracy drop to the treatment of viscous terms in the derivation of the Poisson equation used to update the velocity and pressure fields. This allows us to propose a modified projection method that recovers second-order temporal accuracy. Finally, we show that the modified projection method can be coupled to convective outlet conditions and immersed boundary conditions to simulate reverse osmosis in steady and unsteady flow regimes.},

abstract = {A broad class of engineering problems including penetration, impact and large rotations of solid bodies causes severe numerical problems. For these problems, the constitutive equations are history dependent so material points must be followed; this is difficult to implement in a Eulerian scheme. On the other hand, purely Lagrangian methods typically result in severe mesh distortion and the consequence is ill conditioning of the element stiffness matrix leading to mesh lockup or entanglement. Remeshing prevents the lockup and tangling but then interpolation must be performed for history dependent variables, a process which can introduce errors. Proposed here is an extension of the particle-in-cell method in which particles are interpreted to be material points that are followed through the complete loading process. A fixed Eulerian grid provides the means for determining a spatial gradient. Because the grid can also be interpreted as an updated Lagrangian frame, the usual convection term in the acceleration associated with Eulerian formulations does not appear. With the use of maps between material points and the grid, the advantages of both Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes are utilized so that mesh tangling is avoided while material variables are tracked through the complete deformation history. Example solutions in two dimensions are given to illustrate the robustness of the proposed convection algorithm and to show that typical elastic behavior can be reproduced. Also, it is shown that impact with no slip is handled without any special algorithm for bodies governed by elasticity and strain hardening plasticity.}

   abstract = {The Material Point Method (MPM) discrete solution procedure for computational solid mechanics is generalized using a variational form and a Petrov-Galerkin discretization scheme, resulting in a family of methods named the Generalized Interpolation Material Point (GIMP) methods. The generalization permits identification with aspects of other point or node based discrete solution techniques which do not use a body-fixed grid, i.e. the "meshless methods". Similarities are noted and some practical advantages relative to some of these methods are identified. Examples are used to demonstrate and explain numerical artifact noise which can be expected in MPM calculations. This noise results in non-physical local variations at the material points, where constitutive response is evaluated. It is shown to destroy the explicit solution in one case, and seriously degrade it in another. History dependent, inelastic constitutive laws can be expected to evolve erroneously and report inaccurate stress states because of noisy input. The noise is due to the lack of smoothness of the interpolation functions , and occurs due to material points crossing computational grid boundaries. The next degree of smoothness available in the GIMP methods is shown to be capable of eliminating cell crossing noise. keyword: MPM, PIC, meshless methods, Petrov-Galerkin discretization.},

For each membrane material, we elucidate the impacts to performance using a porous metal frit and woven tricot mesh permeate carrier materials from commercial HPRO, SWRO, BWRO and tap water RO (TWRO) membrane modules. The water permeability of all tested membranes declines with increasing pressure, whereas rejection behaves differently for different combinations of membrane type and permeate carrier. Cross-sectional SEM and FIB-SEM images confirm permanent reduction of the polysulfone support membrane thickness (38% to 60%) as well as collapse of support membrane skin layer pores – both of which may contribute to the observed performance decline. Also, at ultra-high pressures, permeate carrier materials with higher porosity cause greater embossing and, ultimately, coating film damage (defect formation) that leads to increased salt passage (loss of salt rejection). In contrast, the permeate carriers with lower porosity still lost water permeability, but maintained higher rejection. Finally, all of the observed compaction/embossing-related performance decline occurs within about 60 min after a membrane coupon was exposed to ultra-high pressure.}

  title        = {Spectral Analysis of Regular Material Point Method and its Application to Study High Pressure Reverse Osmosis Membrane Compaction and Embossing},
  annote       = {Material Point Method (MPM) is gaining widespread interest in applied continuum mechanics. The fact that all the continuum properties are stored on the particles (or material points) and the governing equations are solved on these material points makes MPM extremely suited to problems involving severe material deformations, such as crack propagation, soil movement, and fluid flows. Despite its popularity, only a few studies have focused on the numerical properties of MPM. This presentation introduces a global spectral analysis of the regular material point method. Contrary to previous studies, the analysis focuses on the numerical properties of the method in the spectral space. The amplification factor is derived as a function of the non- dimensional wave numbers. It provides insights into the stability and dissipative properties of the method for various CFL and Fourier numbers. The effect of the grid shape functions, number of particles per cell and their locations inside the grid cell are also analyzed. The EXAGOOP MPM solver (https://github.com/NREL/Exagoop.git) is developed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory as a part of the NAWI UHPRO project and is based on the AMReX framework. A single-level, uniform cartesian grid is used as the background mesh, while the particle class in AMReX is used to manage the material point operations. Linear hat and B-splines are used as grid shape functions, while the time integration is performed using explicit Euler time integration. EXAGOOP is both CPU and GPU compatible and has been demonstrated to work well on multiple compute architectures. The performance of EXAGOOP on various computing architectures is presented along with its application to study compaction and embossing of high-pressure reverse osmosis membranes. The MPM solution accurately reproduces the membrane deformation. The deformed pore size and structure simulated using MPM also agree well with experimental SEM images.},

  title        = {Simulation of Reverse Osmosis Membrane Compaction Using Material Point Method},
  annote       = {Reverse Osmosis (RO) is a promising technology to address the impending water-crisis in the upcoming decades. RO at high salinities and high pressures is challenging due to membrane compaction that changes its porosity and permeability. In this study, we present a simulation methodology for membrane structural mechanics to understand pore size distribution and permeability variations under high pressure. We use the material point method (MPM), that solves the solid mechanics equations in a Lagrangian framework. MPM provides many features that make it well-suited for simulating mesoporous membranes. The Lagrangian framework allows for large deformations, easy integration of constitutive models and direct import of complex geometries as particles. The spatial discretization in our MPM solver is achieved using linear or cubic-spline shape functions while the time integration is carried out using the explicit Euler method. A series of images containing detailed pore structures obtained from X-ray tomography is first converted to a collection of material points. Compressive loads are applied to the top layer of the membrane to simulate the application of pressure. The membrane deformation and pore size distribution before and after load application are reported and compared with the experimental measurements. The presentation discusses the numerical methods used, the performance of the solver on high-performance computing machines, and the results of membrane compact in detail.},

  title        = {Numerical Analysis of Regular Material Point Method and its Application to Multiphase Flows},
  annote       = {The material point method (MPM) is gaining wide popularity in engineering research to model and simulate complex multiphase flow dynamics. The method relies on solving the governing equations of motion and transport in a Lagrangian framework using particles also known as material points. The fluid and kinematic properties are stored on the material points while the spatial gradient calculation and temporal integration are performed on a background grid. This Lagrangian framework allows for large deformations, easy integration of constitutive models, and direct import of complex geometries as particles. However, despite their increasing popularity, very few studies have addressed the issues of numerical resolution and stability of MPM techniques. The presence of additional factors such as the number of material points-per-cell, the location of the material points, the CFL-like condition used in time update, and the grid shape functions also increase the complexity of the error analysis when compared to other finite element methods. In this presentation, we analyze the various forms of error incurred in the application of MPM to continuum mechanics and multiphase flows. The effect of the previously mentioned factors on the error dynamics is studied. The application of these principles to canonical and industrial problems is also presented.},
